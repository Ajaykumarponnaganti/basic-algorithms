Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

1. Start
2. Input a number n
3. Initialize a variable sum to 0
4. Use a loop to iterate from 1 to n:
   - Add the current number to sum
5. Display the value of sum
6. End






Check for Prime Number

1. Start
2. Input a number n
3. If n is less than 2, it is not a prime number
4. Use a loop to check divisibility from 2 to âˆšn:
   - If n is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number
5. If no divisors are found, n is a prime number
6. Display the result
7. End





Find the Maximum of Three Numbers

1. Start
2. Input three numbers a, b, and c
3. Compare a and b to find the larger of the two
4. Compare the result with c to find the largest number
5. Display the maximum value
6. End









Factorial Calculation

1. Start
2. Input a number n
3. Initialize a variable factorial to 1.
4. Use a loop to multiply all integers from 1 to n:
   - factorial = factorial * i.
5. Display the value of factorial
6. End







Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Start.
2. Input a number n.
3. Check if n is divisible by 2
     If yes, display "Even"
     If no, display "Odd"
4. End
